Problem Statement / Objective :-

Background:

Bombay hospitality Ltd. operates a franchise model for producing exotic Norwegian dinners throughout New England. The operating cost for a franchise in a week (W) is given by the equation W = $1,000 + $5X, where X represents the number of units produced in a week. Recent feedback from restaurant owners suggests that this cost model may no longer be accurate, as their observed weekly operating costs are higher.

Objective:

To investigate the restaurant owners' claim about the increase in weekly operating costs using hypothesis testing.

Data Provided:

The theoretical weekly operating cost model: W = $1,000 + $5X
Sample of 25 restaurants with a mean weekly cost of Rs. 3,050
Number of units produced in a week (X) follows a normal distribution with a mean (μ) of 600 units and a standard deviation (σ) of 25 units
